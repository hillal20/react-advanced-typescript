## Design patterns in JS :

1- Singleton Pattern:  
                    * a class has only one instance,
                    * provides a global point of access to it.



2- Factory Pattern: 
                 * provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass,
                 * allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

3- Observer Pattern:
                *  defines a one-to-many relationship between objects, 
                *  if one  object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

4- Module Pattern: 
               * allows you to encapsulate private and public data and methods in a single object,
               * preventing them from polluting the global namespace.
               

5- Prototype Pattern:
               * allows you to create new objects by cloning existing ones, rather than creating them from scratch.

6- Decorator Pattern:
               *  allows you to add new functionality to an existing object, without altering its structure or behavior.

7- MVC Pattern:
              *  separates an application into three interconnected parts:
                     -  the model (data),
                     -  the view (user interface),
                     -  the controller (handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly).
