updated version of the system design that includes everything we discussed so far:

Front-end:

1-  user-friendly interface   React or Angular.

2-  IndexedDB or localStorage : store the updates made by farmers when they don't have internet connection.

3- The front-end will use navigator.onLine property or fetch API to detect when the internet connection is lost, and store the updates in the offline storage.

5-The front-end will have a mechanism to check the offline storage periodically, and send the updates to the back-end when the connection is back.

6- "Optimistic UI" strategy : the front end send and the backend check if there is an error end send back the info to the front end to do something in case the error

7- "Last write wins" :  last update overwrites any previous updates 


4-  caching mechanism using a library like redux-persist or localForage to store the frequently accessed data, this will help to reduce the load on the back-end and improve the performance of the application.

5- validating the data entered by the farmers, to ensure that the data is accurate and complete.

6-  support multiple languages, to make it accessible to farmers who speak different languages.

7- accessible for users with disabilities, for example by providing alternative text.


Back-end:

1-  processing  and logic  Node.js.

2-  MongoDB database  :  crops,  crop, the number of acres, and the yield. revenue and expenses.

 ===========================================   microservices =======================================================


1- Auth  microservice :  authentication mechanism via   JWT or OAuth  

2- Data validation microservice: farmer inputs 

3- Sync microservice (queue system) :  synchronizing the updates in DB in case of  conflicts (farmers  updates same time). (Conflict Resolution Algorithm) 
```const Queue = require('bull');

// Create a new queue
const queue = new Queue('myQueue');
``` 

4- Notification microservice:  sending notifications to farmers, (consume data from DB or external APIS). the system will notify a human operator in case of 
   conflicts are not solved by CRA (nodemailer,  Twilio, fcm-node, socket.io-client, socket.io) 

5-  Image upload microservice:  upload and storage of images (AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage)


6- Satellite image comparison microservice: the health of the crops 

7 - Analytics microservice: analytics on the crops and Financials, consume data from DB. integrate with external systems :  weather, market.

8- Translation microservice: languages 

=============================================   mechanism ===================================================================

1 -  logging mechanism:  activity,  issues , insights for system improvement (winston)

2 -  Load balancing (async mechanism):  volume of requests  and minimize the waiting time for the clients.  Auto-scaling, traffic.

3 -  caching mechanism :  memcached or redis . 

4 -  security  mechanism :  secure  data ,  encryption (crypto)

5 -  monitoring mechanism :  errors ,  slow performance (AWS CloudWatch or Prometheus).

6 - CDN to distribute the content across multiple servers and locations,

7 - disaster recovery : AWS RDS or AZURE backup
