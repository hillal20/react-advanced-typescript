## experience with communication archiving systems 

        - capturing, indexing, and storing various types of digital communications.
        - integrating  with email servers, social media through APIs and connectors.
        - compliance with data retention policies , secure data storage solutions

###  ensure data security and  compliance 
        -  data is encrypted, transit and at rest. 
        -  strict access controls 
        -  scan for  vulnerabilities.
        -  Compliance  regulations  :  GDPR or FINRA,
        -  implementing retention policies

###  design a scalable archiving solution

        - cloud-based storage
        - distributed architecture for availability 
        - load balancers,
        - optimizing database queries
        - indexing system 
        - incorporate monitoring tools :
                            -  Wireshark (https ), DigiCert Certificate Inspector(SSL, TLS), Tripwire (files and data stored on disk)
                            -  Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) : Splunk
                            -  Audit and Logging Tools : AWS CloudTrail,

### time you had to troubleshoot a complex issue in an archiving system.

        - slow search performance in our archiving system.
        - analyzing the system logs and identifying bottlenecks in the indexing process. 
        - more efficient data structures.
        - This significantly improved search performance and reduced response times."


### integration challenges when working with different communication platforms?

        - reviewing the documentation for each platform and understanding their API capabilities.
        - test custom connectors to ensure compatibility. 
        - work with platform support teams to resolve any issues


### Can you give an example of how you worked with a team to achieve a project goal?

        - led a cross-functional team that included developers,QA engineers, and compliance officers.
        - I coordinated regular meetings to track progress, address issues, and ensure that all team members were aligned with the project goals. 
        -  completed the integration on time and met all compliance requirements 


### situation where you had to make a difficult decision in your role.

        - using an existing but outdated technology 
        - adopt the new technology despite the higher cost.
        - This decision was based on the long-term benefits, such as improved performance and scalability.
        - I presented a detailed analysis to the stakeholders, who agreed with my recommendation


### How do you prioritize tasks when working on multiple projects?

        -  assessing their urgency and impact. 
        -  I use  tools and notes  to keep track of deadlines 
        -  communicate with stakeholders about  priorities
        -  reviewing and adjusting priorities
        -  critical tasks are completed 
        
###  time when you received feedback that was hard to accept? How did you handle it

        -  my documentation for a project was not as detailed
        -  I took it as an opportunity for growth.
        -  I sought clarification on what was lacking
        -  review to ensure that future documentation met higher standards
