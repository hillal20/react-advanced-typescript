###   learning road map 
     - llm (large language model) : generate human-like text base on the input it takes 
          ex : GPT-4, Mistral 7B ,LLama, Hugging Face Open Source LLM , Google Palm ,   BERT, T5, GPT-NEO , GPT-J , Bloom , Megaton-Turing NLG 

     - used in : chatbots, content creation , language translation , summarization....

     - to develop apps with llm , NLP ( natural language processing is needed)

    - openAI : company that aims to develop and ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity

          ex: 
            - GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer): A series of large language models, including GPT-2, GPT-3, and GPT-4, known for their ability to generate human-like text based on input prompts.

            - DALL-E: A model capable of generating images from textual descriptions.

            - Codex: A model that powers GitHub Copilot, an AI assistant for coding that can generate code based on natural language descriptions.

            - CLIP: A model that can understand images and text jointly, enabling powerful image classification and generation tasks.

    - LangChain: 
                * open-source library/framework designed to facilitate the development of applications that use large LLMs
                * aims to simplify the process of integrating LLMs into applications.
                * It provides framework that supports various use cases and configurations
