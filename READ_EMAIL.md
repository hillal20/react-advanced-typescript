Hi [Recruiter’s Name],

Thank you for reaching out! I'm excited about the opportunity to explore this role further.

Java:
I have solid experience developing Java-based backend services using Spring Boot and AWS Lambda. I've built applications that integrate with databases like MongoDB and Postgres, and third-party services  on AWS, focusing on designing RESTful APIs, optimizing queries, and ensuring maintainability.

JavaScript/React:
I’m proficient in JavaScript and React, using hooks, the Context API, and Redux to build dynamic interfaces. My experience extends to Node.js (mainly Express.js) for building and maintaining backend services, including RESTful APIs, Cron jobs, and serverless APIs.

REST APIs:
I’ve designed, developed, and consumed RESTful APIs that handle CRUD operations, authentication, and complex business logic. My APIs are secure, well-documented, and optimized for performance, ensuring seamless integration.

Kubernetes:
I’ve deployed and managed applications using Kubernetes (Azure) , such as for Walgreens’ Client Portal. My work includes creating clusters, writing Helm charts, and maintaining continuous deployment pipelines, ensuring scalability and reliability.

Automated Testing:
I’m a strong advocate for automated testing, implementing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests using tools like Jest, Spock, and Cypress. I also use Shell scripting to automate and streamline the testing process.

Why I’m Looking & What I’m Looking Forward to Learning:
I’m seeking new challenges where I can leverage my full-stack and cloud expertise. The role at Oracle Health excites me because of the focus on modernizing healthcare with AI. I’m eager to contribute to a forward-thinking team and look forward to deepening my skills in AI and cloud-native architectures.

Thank you for considering my application. I’m looking forward to discussing how I can contribute to your team.

Best regards,
Hilal Aissani
