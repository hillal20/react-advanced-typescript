1- SQL databases :
                -  consistency and integrity,
                     * banking systems
                     * inventory systems. 
                -  complex queries,
                     * data analytics
                     * business intelligence 

MongoDB, on the other hand, is a good choice for applications that require high flexibility and scalability, such as social media platforms or real-time data processing systems. It is also good for applications that handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as content management systems or IoT (Internet of Things) applications.

Ultimately, the choice between SQL and MongoDB (or any other database system) depends on the specific needs of the application being developed. It is important to consider factors such as data consistency, scalability, performance, and ease of development when selecting a database system.
